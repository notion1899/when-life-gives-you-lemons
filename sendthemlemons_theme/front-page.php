                        The saying goes that when life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade. In this case, we are replacing life and sending the lemons right to your (or 
friend's!) doorstep. No more waiting around for pesky life to give you lemons, we've got you covered!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With every order you get a wholesome yellow lemon with a custom hand written message! All are lemons are guaranteed to be yellow and very sour.

                        <p>
                            With every order you get one lemon with a hand written message! Also they don't come with an envelope because we like to save trees (that's where lemons 
come from).

                        <p>
                            It takes as long as first class shipping will take. The fact that you only are getting a lemon makes it faster

                        <p>
                            I mean we can't stop you, but like, you really shouldn't. It's touched lots of germy things. Maybe make some lemonde!
